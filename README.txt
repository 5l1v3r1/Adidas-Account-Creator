DISCLAMER:I, XO DID NOT MAKE THE SCRIPTS. I SOLELY INTERGRATED IT INTO A UI TO MAKE IT EASIER TO USE. ALL CREDIT GOES TO @REALCHEFUK WHO I THINK MADE THE PROGRAM.

-I have made some modifications to the python scripts but nothing major. As the script is updated I will roll out updates asap and I will also be editing aspects of this program
In the coming weeks I plan to add auto updates and more features once I can get my website up. If you have any questions my discord is XO
#2324.

(This is part of a larger project I am working on so if you guys cant update see random errors or cant load the program message me asap as I probably pushed a wrong file version)
